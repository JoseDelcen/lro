# Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) 

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ([LRO](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/index.html)) is a robotic mission by NASA that set out to map the moon's surface. These images taken by the instruments of this missions can be found in the following sites:

 - [Planetary Data System (PDS) Image Atlas](https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/)
 - [LROC PDS Archive](http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/data/)
 
In order to create different databases that will be used as a part of a Super-resolution project on them, I have created some scripts to obtain and calibrate them in a automated way.
